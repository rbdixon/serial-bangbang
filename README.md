If you've found the TX pins on a PCB and can see what is being printed during board initialization you next will want to find the RX pin. Sometimes developers get sneaky and move those around. Use this script to transmit on the serial port and listen for something in reply. Connect the output of your serial device (perhaps an FT232R) to a probe and go hunting around the PCB. When your serial port talks back you'll get a beep.
